    <p> Hello, I am Aubrey Mark, I am originally from Utah. I have a 4 month old, born on July 30, 2020, her name is Juniper. My favorite color is yellow, and LOVE to bake! I have a baking company on the side, you can go check it out on FaceBook, called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/charmingsweetsslc">Charming Sweets</a> . I work from home for a company called Lendio, I LOVE working for them, and hoping to stay with them once I complete this program!</p>
